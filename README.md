## Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant results with loading indicators

2. **Generate Icons** (if needed):
   - Open `generate-icons.html` in your browser
   - Click the download buttons to save icons to the `icons/` folder

3. **Click "Scan Page"** to analyze the current webpage
4. **Review** the trust score and any suspicious keywords found
5. **Use the results** to make informed decisions about the content

## How It Works

### Text Extraction
The extension uses a sophisticated text extraction algorithm that:
- Traverses the DOM using TreeWalker
- Filters out hidden elements (display: none, visibility: hidden, etc.)
- Excludes script tags, style tags, and other non-content elements
- Extracts only visible, meaningful text content

### Keyword Detection
TrustGuard searches for suspicious keywords and phrases such as:
- "miracle cure", "you won't believe", "shocking"
- "secret revealed", "doctors hate this", "one weird trick"
- "lose weight fast", "cure cancer", "government conspiracy"
- "clickbait", "viral", "breaking news", "exclusive"
- And many more...

### Trust Score Calculation
- **Starting Score**: 100%
- **Deduction**: 10% per suspicious keyword found
- **Minimum Score**: 0%
- **Color Coding**:
  - üü¢ Green (70-100%): High trust
  - üü° Yellow (40-69%): Medium trust
  - üî¥ Red (0-39%): Low trust
